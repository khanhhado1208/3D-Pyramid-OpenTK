# 3D Pyramid using OpenTK with C# programming language

This project is a 3D pyramid visualization using OpenTK, a .NET binding for OpenGL. The pyramid is rendered with a simple shader and basic 3D transformations such as rotation and projection.

## Features
- **3D rendering:** Displays a rotating 3D pyramid.
- **Shaders:** Uses GLSL shaders for color and outline rendering.
- **Camera:** Implemented using perspective and model-view matrices.
- **Rotation:** The pyramid rotates around the Y-axis.

## Prerequisites
Make sure to have the following installed:
- .NET 5.0 or higher
- OpenTK library (can be installed via NuGet)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/3D-Pyramid-OpenTK.git
 
   cd 3D-Pyramid-OpenTK\ReadFile3D

## Run the application:
dotnet run

The 3D pyramid should appear, rotating along the Y-axis:
